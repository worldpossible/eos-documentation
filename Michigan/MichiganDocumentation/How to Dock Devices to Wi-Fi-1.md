The Endless OS Justice Michigan Image has the Wi-Fi connection to RACHEL preconfigured, meaning that no additional steps are need to access the RACHEL device, given that the Securebook is Docked and in range of the RACHEL device.
Users are not limited to using a singular Red Docking Station. Should the need arise, the user can repeat the steps above on an entirely different Red Docking Station and achieve the same results.
*Note*: For best results, make sure the Securebook is Turned Off when docking to a Red Docking Station.
