## Installing Modules from Zip Files

*Note: RACHEL Zip Module Files can be found on the [RACHEL Website](https://rachel.worldpossible.org/). This is a great resource because modules can be downloaded from the internet and then stored on USB devices to be installed in areas or places that don't have access to the internet*

To install new modules from Zip Files on RACHEL, follow these steps:
1. Connect to RACHEL as Admin
2. Click on the "Settings" Tab
